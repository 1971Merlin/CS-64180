Github repo for documenting and exploring a mystery microcontroller PCB I found in a junk pile. Age is early 1990's

Based on the HD64180 (Zilog Z180) with 8k ROM and 8K RAM and a serial port, this mystery board deserves some exploration!

There is also a bunch of hand made peripheral boards (RS-422 interface, front panel Io board with 3 x 7 Seg dispalys and som switches), but also an apparently off the shelf IO board labelled as made by By Monash University, dated 1988.

ROM Dump & basic disaseembly posted. The device appears to be a signal processor/monitor with display and serial output. it does nothing on the displays or srial port when powered on without any inputs.
