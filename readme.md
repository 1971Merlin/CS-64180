Github repo for documenting and exploring a mystery microcontroller PCB I found in a junk pile. Age is early 1990's

Based on the HD64180 (Zilog Z180) with 8k ROM and 8K RAM and a serial port, this mystery board deserves some exploration!

There is a bunch of peripheral boards, many hand made but also an apparently off the shelf IO board By Monash University dated 1988.
